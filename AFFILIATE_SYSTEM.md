# Affiliate System Documentation

## Overview

The net worth calculator now includes a sophisticated affiliate recommendation system that personalizes offers based on user responses. The system is designed to maximize value for users while generating high-value affiliate commissions ($10+ per user).

## How It Works

### 1. User Data Collection
The system collects the following user data through a multi-step form:
- **Net Worth Range**: <$10k, $10kâ€“$50k, $50kâ€“$100k, $100kâ€“$500k, $500kâ€“$1m, $1m+
- **Current Tracking Method**: Spreadsheet, Free App, Paid Software, None
- **Age Range**: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 65+
- **Financial Goal**: Build Emergency Fund, Pay Off Debt, Save for Retirement, Invest for Growth, Buy a Home, Start a Business
- **Current Products**: Credit Card, Investment Account, Life Insurance, None

### 2. Personalized Recommendations
Based on user responses, the system:
- Filters affiliate offers based on qualification requirements
- Sorts recommendations by commission value (highest first)
- Limits recommendations to 5 total (including Empower)
- Ensures relevance and value for the user

### 3. Tracking & Analytics
Each recommendation includes:
- User ID tracking (`sabeid`)
- Google Click ID tracking (`gclid`)
- UTM parameters for attribution
- User data for personalization
